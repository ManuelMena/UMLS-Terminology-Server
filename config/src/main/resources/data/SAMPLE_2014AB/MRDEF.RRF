Primární p. vzniká bez přítomnosti prokazatelného nitrobřišního onemocnění (hematogenně, lymfogenně, např. tzv. spontánní p. při portální hypertenzi), sekundární vzniká v přímé souvislosti s nitrobřišním onemocněním, jako terciární se označují p. vzniklé v souvislosti s výkonem na orgánech břišní dutiny.

The patches are usually red or purple and are made of cancer cells and blood cells. The red and purple patches often cause no symptoms, though they may be painful. If the cancer spreads to the digestive tract or lungs, bleeding can result. Lung tumors can make breathing hard.</p><p>Before the <a href='http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/hivaids.html'>HIV/AIDS</a> epidemic, KS usually developed slowly. In HIV/AIDS patients, though, the disease moves quickly. Treatment depends on where the lesions are and how bad they are. Treatment for HIV itself can shrink the lesions. However, treating KS does not improve survival from HIV/AIDS itself.</p><p >NIH: National Cancer Institute</p>|N||

C0036572|A0115074|AT13936426||AIR|WHAT: Seizure.	Seizure: a paroxysmal transient disturbance of brain function that may be manifested as episodic impairment or loss of consciousness, abnormal motor phenomena, psychic or sensory disturbance or perturbation of the autonomic brain electrical activity.	WHY:	Seizures may occur in systemic lupus erythematosus or in necrotizing vasculitides such as polyarteritis, eosinophilic granulomatous vasculitis, aortic arch arteritis, or rheumatoid arteritis.	HOW:	A seizure probably exists when there are generalized convulsions or focal motor/sensory phenomenon. GENERALIZED CONVULSIONS may be preceded by an aura but usually have a sudden loss of consciousness with generalized muscle rigidity then generalized muscle activity. They may have incontinence of urine or feces or laceration of the tongue or buccal mucosa. This usually is followed by flaccidity, drowsiness, or complaints of a headache or sore muscles. FOCAL MOTOR/SENSORY PHENOMENON may precede generalized convulsions but may be tonic or clonic muscle activity that is limited to one extremity, one side of the body, or one side of the face or lateralized/localized sensory sensations. These may only be brief sudden involuntary muscle contractions associated with transitory loss of muscle tone and a brief loss of contact with the environment, repetitive automatic behavior patterns, feelings of familiarity or unfamiliarity associated with compulsive thinking, unpleasant epi- gastric sensations that may radiate to the head, or hallucinations of an auditory, vertiginous, olfactory, gustatory, or visual type.

Akutní s. se vedle celkových příznaků (zvýšená teplota, únava, malátnost) projevuje bolestí hlavy (pod okem, v čele, v záhlaví – podle postižené dutiny) a hnisavým výtokem z nosu. Bolest sílí při předklonu hlavy a zesiluje i při došlápnutí. K diagnostice se používá rinoskopie, sinusoskopie, rentgenové vyšetření, diafanoskopie, ultrasonografie. Chronická s. vzniká z nevyléčeného zánětu akutního nebo se od počátku vyvíjí plíživě. Má formu hnisavou nebo polypózní. Vzniká častěji při některých současných změnách na horních cestách dýchacích (nosní polypy aj.), vlivem zevního prostředí či snížené odolnosti organismu. Má méně nápadné příznaky, ale svým přetrváváním nepříznivě působí na celý organismus. Komplikace mohou být celkové a místní.

Léčba s. zahrnuje klid, dostatečné zvlhčování vzduchu, obklady, nosní kapky ke zmírnění zduření sliznice, antibiotika. V těžších případech je nutné provést punkci dutin s jejich výplachem.

Tuberculosis (TB) may affect almost any tissue or organ of the body with the lungs being the most common site of infection. The clinical stages of TB are primary or initial infection, latent or dormant infection, and recrudescent or adult-type TB. Ninety to 95% of primary TB infections may go unrecognized. Histopathologically, tissue lesions consist of granulomas which usually undergo central caseation necrosis. Local symptoms of TB vary according to the part affected; acute symptoms include hectic fever, sweats, and emaciation; serious complications include granulomatous erosion of pulmonary bronchi associated with hemoptysis. If untreated, progressive TB may be associated with a high degree of mortality.

C0044971|A7585044|AT198025360||NCI|A synthetic progestational agent similar to the endogenous progesterone used in hormone therapy or as a female contraceptive. Mimicking the action of progesterone, hydroxyprogesterone caporate binds to and activates nuclear progesterone receptors in the reproductive system and causes the ligand-receptor complex to be translocated to the nucleus where it binds to and promotes expression of target genes. Due to the negative feedback mechanism seen with progesterone, this agent also blocks luteinizing hormone (LH) release from the pituitary gland, thereby leading to an inhibition of ovulation and an alteration in the cervical mucus and endometrium. Furthermore, without stimulation of LH, estrogen release from the ovaries is stopped, hence impeding the growth of estrogen-sensitive tumor cells.|N||

Upon administration, desogestrel binds intracellular progesterone receptors in progesterone responsive tissue and the resultant complex interacts with DNA causing either gene transcription or gene repression. This eventually leads to an inhibition of gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) secretion from the hypothalamus and a subsequent inhibition of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) release. This prevents ovulation and alters the cervical mucus.|N||

C1140111|A19724787|AT144246505||HL7V3.0|<p>The terminology consists of standardized terms and codes for patient problems or life processes expressed as nursing diagnoses. These data elements would be classified by HL7 as "observations". The taxonomy is multi-axial. It consists of 12 domains and 36 classes. All domains and classes are defined. There are 7 axes with definitions for each. Each nursing diagnosis consists of: a concept label or term expressed as a noun or a noun phrase; a definition of the term; a set of defining characteristics (signs and symptoms) of the diagnostic term; an approved list of modifiers of the term; a set of risk factors with definitions; and a set of related factors (or etiologies) for the term. The system preserves semantics by having robust review procedures and policies to ensure against semantic drift in the meanings of the encoded terms over time. NANDA as an organization is committed to updating the terminology on a regular biannual basis. NANDA has been in existence since 1973 and is thus the oldest developer of standardized language in nursing. Most other nursing language systems use many of the older NANDA terms in their vocabularies. The express purpose of the organization is to develop a comprehensive standardized nursing language that captures the conclusions that nurses make based on observations - in effect, the nursing diagnoses. The work is a continuing effort and diagnoses are revised, retired or added bi-annually. The codes are simple integers and are not linked to each other. If a diagnostic term is retired, the code is also retired. If a new diagnosis is added a new code is given to that term. If a diagnostic term is revised, the code is kept intact but the date of the revision is published alongside the term. Domains and classes are not coded.</p>|N||

Rh factor is a protein on red blood cells. Most people are Rh-positive; they have Rh factor. Rh-negative people don't have it. Rh factor is inherited though genes.</p><p>When you're pregnant, blood from your baby can cross into your bloodstream, especially during delivery. If you're Rh-negative and your baby is Rh-positive, your body will react to the baby's blood as a foreign substance. It will create antibodies (proteins) against the baby's blood. These antibodies usually don't cause problems during a first pregnancy.</p> <p>But Rh incompatibility may cause problems in later pregnancies, if the baby is Rh-positive. This is because the antibodies stay in your body once they have formed. The antibodies can cross the placenta and attack the baby's red blood cells. The baby could get Rh disease, a serious condition that can cause a serious type of anemia.</p> <p>Blood tests can tell whether you have Rh factor and whether your body has made antibodies. Injections of a medicine called Rh immune globulin can keep your body from making Rh antibodies. It helps prevent the problems of Rh incompatibility.

C3160961|A19458225|AT140625557||MDRHUN|Az SMQ Terhesség és újszülöttkor témakör kialakítására az eredeti SMQ Terhesség nem kívánatos kimenetele/genitalis toxicitás (beleértve újszülöttkori betegségek) helyettesítése céljából került sor, amelyben ellentmondásosak voltak a belefoglalt kifejezések, és ez karbantartási problémákat vetett fel. A kialakítás másik célja az volt, hogy javuljon az összhang a terhességi és újszülöttkori témakörökhöz kapcsolódó hatósági célkitűzésekkel. Ugyancsak ebben az SMQ-ban kaptak helyet a lactatioval kapcsolatos betegségek is (funkcionális és az újszülött anyatejen keresztüli kitettsége), azonban a fertilitással kapcsolatos témakörök és a fejlődési betegségek nem. Az SMQ kialakításakor referenciaként az Orvosi termékeknek való kitettség a terhesség időszakában EMA útmutatást használták fel: Igény a jóváhagyás utáni adatokra, amelyben a terhesség kimenetelek a következőképpen vannak definiálva: Élve születés, normál; Élve születés, rendellenes (ideértve a terminus előtti, normál terminus szerinti, és terminus túllépéses születést; Gestatiós időhöz képest kicsi magzat/Intrauterin növekedési retardatio; Gyógyszer elvonási syndroma az újszülöttben; malformatiok; és morbiditás); Magzati halál (beleértve méhen kívüli, koraszüléses és halvaszületés); és Terhességmegszakítás. Az alkeresést megvalósító SMQ Terhességmegszakítás és abortus kockázatok az abortusokra (spontán, indukált, halvaszületéses) és az azokhoz kapcsolódó komplikációkra, valamint a terhesség megszakítással összefüggő eljárásokra és vizsgálatokra vonatkoznak. Megnevezésre kerülnek az abortus kockázati tényezői is.|N||
