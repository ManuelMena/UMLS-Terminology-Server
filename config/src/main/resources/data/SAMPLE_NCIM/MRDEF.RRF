People with celiac disease cannot tolerate gluten, a protein in wheat, rye, barley, and in some products such as medicines, vitamins, and lip balms. When affected people eat food with gluten, or use a product with gluten, the immune system reacts by damaging tiny parts of the lining of the small intestine called villi. Because villi normally allow the blood to absorb nutrients from food, affected individuals become malnourished. Classic signs and symptoms are caused by inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract and may include diarrhea, weight loss, abdominal pain, swelling, and food intolerance. However, many people have other symptoms involving many body systems, and some people have no symptoms. While celiac disease tends to run in families, it does not follow a specific inheritance pattern. The risk to develop celiac disease is raised by having certain forms of the <a href="http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/HLA-DQA1" target="_blank"><em>HLA-DQA1</em></a> and <a href="http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/HLA-DQB1" target="_blank"><em>HLA-DQB1</em></a> genes.

Metals form ligands in the body with the sulfhydryl groups of the pyruvate-oxidase enzyme system. This leads to an inhibition of the normal functioning of these enzymes that are dependent on free sulfhydryl groups for their activity.

C0012702|A6886826|AT57530032||NCI|A class IA anti-arrhythmic agent with cardiac depressant property. Disopyramide blocks the fast sodium channel in normal cardiac cell membranes within atrial and ventricular tissues. This slows the rate and amplitude of phase 0 depolarization and thus prolongs the duration of the action potential, thereby reducing cell excitability and conduction velocity. Further, disopyramide directly decreases the rate of diastolic (phase 4) depolarization in cells with normal or augmented automaticity. Disopyramide also blocks potassium channel and results in prolonged QT interval, thus increases the effective refractory period. This agent also possesses anticholinergic property.|N||

Dopamine is a naturally occurring catecholamine formed by decarboxylation of dehydroxyphenylalanine and a precursor of norepinephrine and epinephrine. Dopamine binds to alpha-1 and beta-1 adrenergic receptors. Mediated through myocardial beta-1 adrenergic receptors, dopamine increase heart rate and force, thereby increasing cardiac output. Alpha-1 adrenergic receptor stimulation on vascular smooth muscle, leads to vasoconstriction and results in an increase in systemic vascular resistance. Stimulation of dopaminergic receptors in renal vasculature, leads to renal blood vessel dilation, and an increase in glomerular filtration rate, renal blood flow, sodium excretion, and urine output.|N||

C0013092|A6886837|AT50112739||NCI|A first generation ethanolamine with antiinflammatory, sedative and antihistamine properties. Doxylamine competitively inhibits the histamine 1 (H1) receptor, thereby preventing the action of endogenous histamine as well as the subsequent release of pro-inflammatory mediators from basophils and mast cells. This agent acts as an inverse agonist that combines with, and stabilizes the inactive form of the H1-receptor, shifting the H1 receptor equilibrium toward the inactive state. This results in downregulation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) and NF-kappaB dependent antigen presentation, chemotaxis, as well as expression of cell-adhesion molecules and pro-inflammatory cytokines.|N||

Many drugs used in the treatment of psychotic disorders (ANTIPSYCHOTIC AGENTS) are dopamine antagonists, although their therapeutic effects may be due to long-term adjustments of the brain rather than to the acute effects of blocking dopamine receptors. Dopamine antagonists have been used for several other clinical purposes including as ANTIEMETICS, in the treatment of Tourette syndrome, and for hiccup. Dopamine receptor blockade is associated with NEUROLEPTIC MALIGNANT SYNDROME.|N||

For example:</p><ul><li><p>a person or animal who carried an infectious disease and interacts (EXSRC) with another person or animal (EXPTRGT) transmitting the disease agent;</p></li><li><p>a place or other environment (EXSRC) and a person or animal (EXPTRGT) who is exposed in the presence of this environment.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>When it is unknown whether a participating entity is the source of the agent (EXSRC) or the target of the transmission (EXPTRGT), the "exposure participant" (EXPART) is used.</p></li><li><p>The physical (including energy), chemical or biological substance which is participating in the exposure uses the "exposure agent" (EXPAGNT) participation. There are at least three scenarios:</p><ol><li><p>the player of the Role that participates as EXPAGNT is the chemical or biological substance mixed or carried by the scoper-entity of the Role (e.g., ingredient role); or</p></li><li><p>the player of the Role that participates as EXPAGNT is a mixture known to contain the chemical, radiological or biological substance of interest; or</p></li><li><p>the player of the Role that participates as a EXPAGNT is known to carry the agent (i.e., the player is a fomite, vector, etc.).</p></li></ol></li></ul><p>The Exposure.statusCode attribute should be interpreted as the state of the Exposure business object (e.g., active, aborted, completed) and not the clinical status of the exposure (e.g., probable, confirmed). The clinical status of the exposure should be associated with the exposure via a subject observation.</p><p><i>Design Comment:</i>The usage notes require a clear criterion for determining whether an act is an exposure or substance administration-deleterious potential, uncertainty of actual transmission, or otherwise. SBADM states that the criterion is the presence of a performer-but there are examples above that call this criterion into question (e.g., the first one, concerning a dosing error).</p>|N||

The diaphragm is the muscle wall that separates the stomach from the chest. The diaphragm helps keep acid from coming up into the esophagus. When you have a hiatal hernia, it's easier for the acid to come up. The leaking of acid from the stomach into the esophagus is called <a href='http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/gerd.html'>gastroesophageal reflux disease</a> (GERD). GERD may cause symptoms such as </p> <ul> <li><a href='http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/heartburn.html'>Heartburn</a></li> <li><a href='http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/swallowingdisorders.html'>Problems swallowing</a></li> <li>A dry <a href='http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/cough.html'>cough</a></li> <li><a href='http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/badbreath.html'>Bad breath</a></li> </ul> <p>Hiatal hernias are common, especially in people over age 50.
