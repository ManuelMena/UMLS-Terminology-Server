C0018717|A21083080|AT156441421||SOP|Medicare - This is a nationwide health insurance program providing health insurance protection to people 65 years of age and over, people entitled to Social Security disability payments for 2 years or more, and people with end-stage renal disease, regardless of income. The program was enacted July 30, 1965, as Title XVIII, Health Insurance for the Aged of the Social Security Act, and became effective on July 1, 1966. From its inception, it has included two separate but coordinated programs: hospital insurance (Part A) and supplementary medical insurance (Part B). In 1999, additional choices were allowed for delivering Medicare Part A and Part B benefits. Medicare Advantage, previously Medicare+Choice, (Part C) is an expanded set of options for the delivery of health care under Medicare, created in the Balanced Budget Act passed by Congress in 1997. The term Medicare Advantage refers to options other than original Medicare. While all Medicare beneficiaries can receive their benefits through the original fee-for-service (FFS) program, most beneficiaries enrolled in both Part A and Part B can choose to participate in a Medicare Advantage plan instead. Organizations that seek to contract as Medicare Advantage plans must meet specific organizational, financial, and other requirements. Most Medicare Advantage plans are coordinated care plans, which include health maintenance organizations (HMOs), provider-sponsored organizations (PSOs), preferred provider organizations (PPOs), and other certified coordinated care plans and entities that meet the standards set forth in the law. The Medicare Advantage program also includes Medical savings account (MSA) plans, which provide benefits after a single high deductible is met, and private, unrestricted FFS plans, which allow beneficiaries to select certain private providers. These programs are available in only a limited number of states. For those providers who agree to accept the plan's payment terms and conditions, this option does not place the providers at risk, nor does it vary payment rates based on utilization. Only the coordinated care plans are considered managed care plans. Except for MSA plans, all Medicare Advantage plans are required to provide at least the current Medicare benefit package, excluding hospice services. Plans may offer additional covered services and are required to do so (or return excess payments) if plan costs are lower than the Medicare payments received by the plan. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act (MMA) was passed on December 8, 2003. The MMA established a voluntary drug benefit for Medicare beneficiaries and created a new Medicare Part D. People eligible for Medicare can choose to enroll in Part D beginning in January of 2006.

C0018720|A21083048|AT156441432||SOP|Health maintenance organization (HMO) - A health care system that assumes both the financial risks associated with providing comprehensive medical services (insurance and service risk) and the responsibility for health care delivery in a particular geographic area to HMO members, usually in return for a fixed, prepaid fee. Financial risk may be shared with the providers participating in the HMO.|N||
C0025071|A21082950|AT156441414||SOP|Medicaid - Medicaid was authorized by Title XIX of the Social Security Act in 1965 as a jointly funded cooperative venture between the Federal and State Governments to assist States in the provision of adequate medical care to eligible needy persons. Within broad Federal guidelines, each of the States establishes its own eligibility standards; determines the type, amount, duration, and scope of services; sets the rate of payment for services; and administers its own program. Medicaid is the largest program providing medical and health-related services to America's poorest people. However, Medicaid does not provide medical assistance for all poor persons. Under the broadest provisions of the Federal statute, Medicaid does not provide health care services even for very poor childless adults under age 65 years unless they are disabled. Except as noted, all States must provide Medicaid coverage to: Individuals who meet the requirements for the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program that were in effect in their State on July 16, 1996, or, at State option, more liberal criteria (with some exceptions); Children under age 6 whose family income is at or below 133 percent of the Federal poverty level; Pregnant women whose family income is below 133 percent of the Federal poverty level (services to these women are limited to those related to pregnancy, complications of pregnancy, delivery, and postpartum care); Supplemental Security Income (SSI) recipients in most States (some States use more restrictive Medicaid eligibility requirements that predate SSI); Recipients of adoption or foster care assistance under Title IV of the Social Security Act; Special protected groups (typically individuals who lose their cash assistance due to earnings from work or from increased Social Security benefits, but who may keep Medicaid for a period of time); All children under age 19 in families with incomes at or below the Federal poverty level; Certain Medicare beneficiaries (low income is only one test for Medicaid eligibility for those within these groups; their resources also are tested against threshold levels, as determined by each State within Federal guidelines). States also have the option of providing Medicaid coverage for other groups. Medicaid operates as a vendor payment program. States may pay health care providers directly on a fee-for-service basis, or States may pay for Medicaid services through various prepayment arrangements, such as health maintenance organizations (HMOs) or other forms of managed care. Within Federally imposed upper limits and specific restrictions, each State for the most part has broad discretion in determining the payment methodology and payment rate for services. Thus, the Medicaid program varies considerably from State to State, as well as within each State over time.|N||
