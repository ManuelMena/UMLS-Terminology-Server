The&nbsp;main feature that separates CVID from other immunodeficiencies is low levels of two specific antibodies, immunoglobulin A (IgA) and immunoglobulin G (IgG). People with CVID get more frequent infections, particularly in the sinuses, lungs, and digestive tract. Symptoms most commonly begin in early adulthood but have been found in children as young as age two. While in&nbsp;most cases the cause of CVID is unknown, the condition has been associated with changes (<a href="http://www.genome.gov/Glossary/index.cfm?id=134" target="_blank">mutations</a>)&nbsp;in at least 10 <a href="http://www.genome.gov/glossary/index.cfm?id=70" target="_blank">genes</a>.

Alpha-1 adrenergic receptor stimulation on vascular smooth muscle, leads to vasoconstriction and results in an increase in systemic vascular resistance.

C0019247|A2745858|AT101451597||NCI|Genetic diseases are diseases in which inherited genes predispose to increased risk. The genetic disorders associated with cancer often result from an alteration or mutation in a single gene. The diseases range from rare dominant cancer family syndrome to familial tendencies in which low-penetrance genes may interact with other genes or environmental factors to induce cancer. Research may involve clinical, epidemiologic, and laboratory studies of persons, families, and populations at high risk of these disorders.|N||

C1333135|A2726511|AT18332447||NCI|These genes encode more than 30 proteins of the complement system engaged in host defense. This system provides both an independent immune system capable of attacking microbes as well as other foreign material and an adjunct to the antibody system. Once activated, the complement system fires in a cascade-like fashion in which one component activates the next. Both swift and powerful, millions of complement components can deposit on an invading microbe within only a few minutes. Such a potent system requires strict regulation to avoid host injury. Membrane cofactor protein (MCP) is one critical regulator aimed at controlling inadvertent complement activation on host cells and nearly every cell examined expresses MCP on its cell membrane.
