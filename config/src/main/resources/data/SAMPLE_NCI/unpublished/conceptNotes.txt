C3827091|A new NCIt PT was added in Protege: PEG-Proline-Interferon Alfa-2b.  The definition was amended as follows: A long-acting formulation of recombinant interferon alpha subtype 2b (IFN-a2b) protein, in which IFN-a2b is coupled, via proline, to polyethylene glycol (PEG), with antiviral, immunomodulating and antineoplastic activities. Upon subcutaneous administration, IFN-a2b binds to specific interferon cell-surface receptors. This activates interferon-mediated signal transduction pathways and induces the transcription and translation of genes with interferon-specific response elements (ISREs); the protein products mediate antiviral, antiproliferative, anticancer, and immune-modulating effects. The PEG moiety inhibits proteolytic breakdown and clearance of IFN-a2b, which prolongs its half-life, extends the duration of its therapeutic effects and allows less frequent dosing. The proline linker facilitates the synthesis of a predominant (90%) positional isomer which allows for further increases in stability and a longer half-life than previous PEG conjugates. Two additional SYs were also added: PEG-P-IFN-Alfa-2b, PEG-P-IFN-Alpha-2b. Please do not merge with CN#1110588 as these are not synonymous. 12/31/13 GSC|E-HAG|23-MAR-16

C0268344|From OMIM (http://www.omim.org/entry/229200): The kyphoscoliotic type of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS VI) was at one time separated into EDS VIA (with lysyl hydroxylase deficiency) and EDS VIB (with normal lysyl hydroxylase activity). The designation EDS VIB was then thought to include the brittle cornea syndrome. Another entity formerly called EDS VIB is now known as the musculocontractural type of EDS (601776), caused by mutation in the CHST14 gene. 10/3/14 GSC|E-GSC|03-OCT-14

Since this organism was originally presumed to be a protozoan, the species name was created with one 'i' and then latter changed to reflect its true nature.
